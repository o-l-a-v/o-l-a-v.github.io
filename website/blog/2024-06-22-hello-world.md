## Hello world

I created this web page with the following goals:

* To learn more about SSGs (**s**tatic **s**ite **g**enerators) and GitHub pages (host static web pages).
* To have a permanent place to store content, instead of forums that come and go.
  * Universal, easily reusable format.
  * Stable format (markdown), requires less maintenance and adaptation.
  * Easily exportable, if other output formats is neccessary in the future.
* To make content and information that might not be easily available in other places. And make this content easily discoverable too.
* To make myself create even better notes and guides (not only intended for my own consumption).
