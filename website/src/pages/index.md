## About this page

Welcome to my homepage!

This page was created for my own learning, but also for sharing public content in a better way than `.md` files inside a GitHub repo.

My two main interests are tech and bicycles, so that's what you'll find content about.

## About me

I'm a tech and bicycle nerd living in Oslo, Norway ![flag-no](/img/flag-no.svg). I've worked primarily with Azure ![azure](/img/azure.svg), PowerShell ![pwsh](/img/pwsh.svg) and Intune ![intune](/img/intune.svg) as a consultant since 2018.
