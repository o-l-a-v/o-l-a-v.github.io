:::warning

* This guide is old, newer Fox Float forks might be different.
* I'm not responsible for any damages. This is your own doing. You have been warned.
  * If this looks too hard, get your fork to a professional bike shop instead. Fox forks are damn expensive.

## Background

Lowering Fox Float forks is really easy, but getting the needed information on how to do it, is hard. I wanted to lower my Fox 831 32mm from 100mm to 80mm, and wanted to document the process while I did it. The result is a guide which I hope others might enjoy for similar purposes.
Here is my before and after shots, for inspiration:

## F.A.Q

### What forks?

This guide should work for all Fox Float forks, including:

* Fox 831 (32mm, 34mm, 36mm)
* Fox Float 32mm, 34,mm, 36mm, for 26", 27.5", 29.5" wheels.

### Why should I change the travel of my fork?

* If you make it shorter, the front of the bike will get lower. This will change the geometry of the bike.

* **Shorter travel/ shorter total length:** Lower bb height and steeper angle of the head tube. Less travel. Need more air pressure to not bottom out.
* **More travel / longer total length:** The opposite.

### How much can I change the travel?

The fork can be lowered from the given max travel on the fork, and theoreticly down to 0mm of travel (Which will leave the fork completely useless..)

### How much spacers do I need to get the fork the height i want?

If you want to lower it 20mm, you just use one 20mm spacer.
If you want your fork 20mm higher, you just take out one 20mm spacer

### "I need help for a different Fox fork"

Fox has made a whole lot of information available for us customers. You can get it all here:

## Requirements

Stuff you will need:

![requirements](https://i.imgur.com/FVGg2Kz.jpg)

### Tools

* 24mm wrench or socket key for Fox 32 forks, 32mm wrench or socket key for Fox 36 forx.
  * Adjustable wrench is _not_ recommended, the air top cap is made of soft aluminium.
  * Dedicated flattened sockets for fork/suspension use is recommended.
* 10mm socket key.
* Shock pump
* Hex or torx keys (to remove the stem and headset)
* Cups (to gather the oil)
* Toilet paper
* Torque wrench, which measures newton meter (nm). Check ridefox tech sites to find recommended torque.
* Measuring cup or syringe.

### Parts

* Spacer (25mm Ã˜ is used for 32mm, 34mm and 36mm.

### Lubricant

* Fox Float Fluid Anti-Fraction Lube (for the seals and top chamber, Fox says this is ESSENTIAL to prevent air leak)
* Grease, lithium based (for nuts and threads)
* Fork oil, Fox 10wt Green is recommended by Fox. You can reuse the old oil, but new oil is always better).

**How much oil + how hard the bolts need to be tightened, will be covered later!**

## Process

Let's start.. The whole process ONLY involves the air side of the fork:

### 1. Remove fork from the bicycle

Remove stem, headset and front wheel from the fork

### 2. IMPORTANT: Let the air out

If you fail this step something fatal WILL happen.

### 3. Condence the fork

![condense-fork](https://i.imgur.com/6eqmt37.jpg)

### 4. Unscrew the 10mm nut in the bottom

CHILL: No oil will get out yet.

### 5. Unscrew the air top cap

:::warning

* The air top cap is made of soft aluminium and is easily damaged.
* Adjustable wrench is NOT recommended, even though I used it.

### 6. Get the oil (float fluid) out at the top

If you don't have new oil: Keep it for later.

IMPORTANT: The oil at the top differs from the oil at the bottom. Do not blend!

### 7. Push bottom bolt

Press the bottom bolt in to the fork, by tapping gently with a hammer. Let the oil drain

### 8. Get the assembly out

Use something to press the whole thing from the bottom and out at the top. As soon as you can grab the top with your hands: Do so, and drag the whole thing out

### 9. Prepare spacers

You should've already decide how much you want to lower/rise your fork.

* I want to go from 100mm to 80mm, so I use a 20mm spacer.
* TIP: Measure the spacers just in case!

### 10. Make room for more spacers

Slide the old spacers down to get space for the new one(s)

* If you are going to extend the travel of your fork; remove spacers and jump to step 13.

### 11. Get the spacer in place

It should look like this:

### 12. Prepare Foxfloat fluid

Take some float fluid in a small syringe. This is the easiest way to lubricate gaskets and stuff.

![prepare-float-fluid](https://i.imgur.com/2lkajbv.jpg)

### 13. Stick the whole thing back in

Not so much that the bolt get through the whole at the bottom. Get some float fluid on gaskets, seals, and stuff

![reinsert](https://i.imgur.com/TGE2sCe.jpg)

### 14. Get some oil in the bottom

Fox recommends Fox 10wt green.

* **Fox Float 32/831:** 30ml/cc
* **Fox Float 36 160mm:** 25ml/cc
* **Fox Float 36 180mm** 40ml/cc

![fill-bottom](https://i.imgur.com/4HFRlNi.jpg)

### 15. Fasten bottom nut

Press the whole thing further down, so the bolt gets out at the bottom. Grease the bolt, and get the nut back on

NB: The nut is made of aluminium, therefore it's very important that you don't over tighten it! Fox says **5.7 newtonmeter**.
![fasten-bottom-nut](https://i.imgur.com/Aho0nWz.jpg)

### 16. Get 5 ml/cc of Fox Fluid at the top

![fill-top](https://i.imgur.com/F03Fmgl.jpg)

### 17. Lubricate the top cap with some Fox Fluid

Both seals and threads

![lubricate-seals](https://i.imgur.com/TdrmLNm.jpg)

### 18. Mount the air top cap

Tighten it to **24-25 newtonmeter**

![mount-air-top-cap](https://i.imgur.com/UPPYjLo.jpg)

### 19. Add air

When everything is tight, get some air in that fork

### 20. CONGRATS! You are finished
