## Context

Contour Action Cameras is dead, and thus it's hard to find firmware, software and manuals for their products.

* [2013-08-06 - GeekWire.com - "Contour closes Seattle HQ, shocks employees â€” execs mum on status of GoPro rival"](https://www.geekwire.com/2013/contour-closes-seattle-hq-surprises-employees-execs-mum-status-gopro-rival/)

I've tried to gather what I could find of their Contour Storyteller software, but also firmware and manuals for various cameras. These files were downloaded from [contour.jp/software](http://www.contour.jp/software.html) and [contour.com/storyteller](http://contour.com/storyteller).
